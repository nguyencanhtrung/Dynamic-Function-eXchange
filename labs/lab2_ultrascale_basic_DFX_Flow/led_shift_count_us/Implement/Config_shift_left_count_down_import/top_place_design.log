WARNING: [Constraints 18-5648] For reconfigurable module inst_count, the top/bottom edges of its PBLOCK pblock_inst_count are aligned with clock regions. With this type of floorplan, it has limited routability at PBLOCK top/bottom edges due to routing containment requirement. The edge tiles (only listed 10) are CLE_M_X1Y240 CLEL_R_X1Y240 CLEL_R_X2Y240 CLE_M_X3Y240 : . Tool will infer PROHIBIT on those tiles to enhancement routability at the edges of PBLOCK. You may also make the PBLOCK not aligned to clock region at top/bottom edges as a solution. Please refer 'Design Consideration' in UG909 for guidelines.
