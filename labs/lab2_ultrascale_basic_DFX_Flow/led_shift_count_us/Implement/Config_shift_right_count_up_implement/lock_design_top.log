WARNING: [Constraints 18-4434] Global Clock Buffer 'U0_clocks/clkf_buf' is LOCed to site 'BUFGCE_X1Y49'. Using a LOC constraint to assign the placement of a Global Clock Buffer can result in sub-optimal placement results.
Resolution: Remove the LOC constraint and use the CLOCK_REGION constraint to assign a Global Clock Buffer to a CLOCK_REGION.
WARNING: [Constraints 18-4434] Global Clock Buffer 'U0_clocks/clkout1_buf' is LOCed to site 'BUFGCE_X1Y48'. Using a LOC constraint to assign the placement of a Global Clock Buffer can result in sub-optimal placement results.
Resolution: Remove the LOC constraint and use the CLOCK_REGION constraint to assign a Global Clock Buffer to a CLOCK_REGION.
